## by Idongesit Offiong


## Dataset

The dataset used in this investigation is Prosper Loan dataset from https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv.. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, loan original amount and many others.


## Summary of Findings

After the analysis of the prosper loan dataset, the following pattern were observed:

1.Most of the loans in the dataset are current loans some are completed
2.Most loans were taken for a perios of 36 months(3 years)
3.Loans with higher APR tends to be past dues, charged off whereas, completed loans have lower APR
4.There is a strong positive correlation between BorrowerAPR and BorrowerRate
5.The loan original amount does not affect the loan status


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on exploring the features of interest to discover which loan features affect the loan status.

I started by introducing the features of interes, followed by how it relate to other variables like original loan amount.
